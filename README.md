# joblint-chrome
A Chrome Extension that helps check tech job listings for sexism, culture, expectations, and recruiter fails -

Based on Rowan Manning's [joblint](https://github.com/rowanmanning/joblint)

Built as my first chrome extension to get a feeling for Chrome extension development, and help with job searches.
